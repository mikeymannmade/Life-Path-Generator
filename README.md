# Life-Path-Generator
*Thank you to [Seth Skorkowsky](https://skorkowsky.com/) for their video on [Traveller Character Creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEwwopcCONY&list=PL25p5gPY6qKVUg6ys5N1oRlsBI7DTByyI). I watched it countless times while working on this project.*

## Description
This program generates a Traveller 2e TTRPG character sheet for player characters and NPCs with their respective "backstories" listing all events following the Traveller Life Path system. I felt this would be a fun project to work on between my classes, and it has proven to be a well rounded ambitious challenge that I'm having a lot of fun with.
